# Notebooks


## Overview

This repository contains a curated collection of Jupyter notebooks focused on data analysis and exploratory data analysis (EDA) across multiple real-world domains such as banking, customer churn, and related business datasets.

The notebooks were originally created independently while analyzing different datasets. They are now consolidated into a single repository for better organization, reproducibility, and reference.

## The emphasis of this repository is on:

Understanding data

Extracting insights

Identifying patterns and anomalies

Preparing data for downstream machine learning tasks
